## Abstract
I tried intuitive visualizations of important concepts introduced
in "Linear Algebra for Everyone".

This is aimed at promoting understanding of vector/matrix calculations
and algorithms from the perspectives of matrix factorizations.
They include Column-Row ($CR$), Gaussian Elimination ($LU$),
Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization ($QR$), Eigenvalues and Diagonalization ($Q \Lambda Q^T$),
and Singular Value Decomposition ($U \Sigma V^T$).
